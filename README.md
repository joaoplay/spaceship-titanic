# Spaceship Titanic

Welcome to my solution for the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle competition. This notebook is a short version of the whole experiments Iâ€™ve done in this competition. I tried other methods (most of them to explore new methods or even just for fun), but Xgboost was the best one I found. I confess that I did not have enough time to test different combinations of parameters. On June 19, this solution got a score of 0.80687 (201 out of 2279 participants). Please feel free to leave your comments and suggestions. I would be happy to hear from you!
